  You found my corner of the internet. I'm currently a predoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence">Center for Applied AI</a> at Chicago Booth. I think LLMs are pretty cool. 
  Before coming to CAAI, I worked on the payment products team at Amazon, and investing at Bridgewater Associates.

  I'm originally from the Bay Area, and I graduated from Harvard College in 2024, where I studied Applied Math and Global Health and Health Policy.
